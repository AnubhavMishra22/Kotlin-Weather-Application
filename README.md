# Kotlin-Weather-Application

There are a lots of weather application available in Google Play Store. But we may want to develop our own weather application in Android Studio.There are free APIs available in the market to use them to get weather informations like Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Weather status, Time of Sunrise and Sunset etc. We have created an android weather app using Kotlin in Android Studio in this project.

There are many websites you can get by searching on the Google which supply free weather Api, but In this tutorial we are going to use a Api provided by OpenWeatherMap. So letâ€™s start to create a weather app.
